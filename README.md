# Task Completed

• As a user, when I open the app, I want to see all the launches for the next 3 months, plotted on
a map or globe.
• As a user, I want to be able to select a start date and an end date so I can filter the launches
according to my selection.
• As a user, I want to be able to select a point on the map and see the name, time of launch, name
of the launch pad and the agencies that are collaborating on the launch.
• As a user, I want to receive feedback when the app is loading so that I know that when I change
something in the UI, something is being loaded
• As a user, I want to be able to filter the launches based on whether or not they were successful. ( Partially done, has some issue )
• As a user, I want to receive feedback when the app encounters an error in reaching the API.


# Things I can do if there is more time

1. Since the documentation was some confusing with multiple simiar endpoints related to launch it has taken my major time at start to find which endpoint gives required response.
2. I would complete the remaining tasks.
3. Fix the issue that was occuring in Select success/failure dropdown.
4. I have written only one unit test, I would have written the remaining test for all components.
5. Better code structuring I have done, and better styling for the page.
6. I would have better tested my code.
